  <h2>Steps:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>To the coffee filter add, 2 tablespoons of coffee in the upper compartment (one with perforations).</li>
    <li>Spread the coffee with a spoon or your hands and then press the coffee with the disc.</li>
    <li>Add boiling water and fill until it’s almost filled to the top.</li>
    <li>Cover with the lid and let the coffee percolate into the lower lower vessel for 20 to 30 minutes. This time may be more if your filter is bigger.</li>
    <li>After 20 minutes or so open the lid, all the water would have percolated in the lower chamber by now and what you have is a strong coffee decoction.</li>
    <li>To make one single serving of coffee- add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of hot coffee decoction to your cup again this depends on how strong coffee you prefer.</li>
    <li>Stir in sugar to taste, or skip sugar if you don’t want like sugar in your coffee.</li>
    <li>Add in hot milk, this could be 1/3 to 1/2 cup depending on how much milk you like.</li>
    <li>Now, to make it frothy and dissolve the sugar, pour the coffee from one tumbler to another.</li>
    <li>Pour from a height so that you get nice froth. Repeat this couple of times until it’s frothy.</li>
