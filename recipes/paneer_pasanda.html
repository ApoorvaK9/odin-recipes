  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>A rich and flavorful North Indian dish made with paneer (Indian cottage cheese) stuffed with a spiced filling and cooked in a creamy gravy.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons oil or ghee</li>
    <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons ginger-garlic paste</li>
    <li>2 large tomatoes, pureed</li>
    <li>1/4 cup cashew nuts (soaked in warm water)</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
    <li>2-3 green cardamom pods</li>
    <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    <li>1 cup water</li>
    <li>1/2 cup fresh cream</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped coriander leaves (for garnish)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a bowl, mix khoya, chopped nuts, raisins, cardamom powder, saffron strands (if using), salt, fresh cream, and chopped coriander leaves.</li>
    <li>Cut the paneer into slices of about 1/4 inch thickness.</li>
    <li>Carefully slit each slice horizontally, making sure not to cut all the way through, creating a pocket.</li>
    <li>Stuff each pocket with the prepared filling.</li>
    <li>Heat oil or ghee in a pan over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Carefully place the stuffed paneer slices in the pan and shallow fry until golden brown on both sides.</li>
    <li>Remove and set aside.</li>
    <li>Blend the soaked cashew nuts with a little water to make a smooth paste.</li>
    <li>Heat oil or ghee in a pan over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Add cumin seeds, cardamom pods, and bay leaf. Sauté for a few seconds until fragrant.</li>
    <li>Add the finely chopped onions and sauté until golden brown.</li>
    <li>Add ginger-garlic paste and cook until the raw smell disappears.</li>
    <li>Add the tomato puree and cook until the oil separates from the mixture.</li>
    <li>Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and salt. Mix well.</li>
    <li>Add the cashew paste and cook for a few minutes, stirring continuously.</li>
    <li>Add water and bring the gravy to a simmer. Cook until it thickens slightly.</li>
    <li>Stir in the fresh cream and garam masala powder. Mix well and cook for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Check for seasoning and adjust salt if needed.</li>
    <li>Gently place the shallow-fried paneer sandwiches into the gravy.</li>
    <li>Let them simmer in the gravy for 5-7 minutes so they absorb the flavors.</li>
    <li>Garnish with chopped coriander leaves.</li>
    <li>Serve hot with naan, roti, or rice.</li>
  </ol>
